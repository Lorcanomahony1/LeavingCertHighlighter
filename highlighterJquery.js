(b) Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. European rabbits were introduced by settlers into Australia in 1859. Within 70 years the rabbit population grew enormously across most of the continent. The rapid spread of the rabbit led to the destruction of large areas of vegetation, leading to the extinction of many plant species. Loss of vegetation leads to soil erosion as the exposed soil is washed or blown away, removing valuable soil nutrients required for new plants to develop. This soil is typically deposited in waterways, causing siltation and destroying aquatic ecosystems. Farmers battled the problem, fencing their properties with special netting, using poisons, digging out warrens and finally introducing the Myxoma virus as a form of biological control. This virus, a benign parasite of the Brazilian forest rabbit, was lethal for European rabbits. It quickly reduced Australia’s rabbits to a mere 5% of former numbers. However, this solution was not long-lasting and rabbit numbers recovered. (i) Describe a procedure for estimating rabbit numbers in an ecosystem.

(30, 30) (a) Read the article below and answer the questions that follow: Cigarettes are bad for your health. But that’s only if you smoke them. If you use them to line your nest, they might actually do some good. Scientists have recently found that birds that decorate their nests with discarded cigarette butts full of nicotine are less bothered by parasites.* When building a nest, birds tend to make do with the materials at hand. Twigs and leaves are popular choices. Some fresh green leaves give off strong smells. So how can city birds manage? Apparently, some reach for the fibres found in used cigarette filters. Scientists got to wondering whether this habit might provide the birds with benefits other than bedding. So they investigated the nests of finches and sparrows that were living on the campus of the National University of Mexico, which is in the heart of Mexico City. The scientists used heat traps to lure the parasites and then counted them. Most of the nests contained cellulose fibres from broken cigarette filters. They found that nests with the most used cigarette filter fibres had the lowest number of parasites, in this case, blood sucking mites. For these birds, a butt a day might keep the mites away! *[Biology Letters: M. Suarez-Rodriguez, I. Lopez-Rull, C.

A pair of foxes will occupy a territory and will defend it from other foxes in the breeding season. Territory boundaries are marked with scent and urine. Red foxes are usually solitary and hunt alone except during the breeding season, when they hunt in family groups. The young accompany the parents while hunting and foraging in order to learn skills. Red foxes do not hibernate and are active all year round though they are nocturnal in habit. They are omnivores but they prefer animals such as small rodents, frogs, insects and birds.

But the cyclamen mites quickly re-invaded the strawberry fields while the mites that preyed on them returned much more slowly. The result was that the cyclamen mites rapidly increased in density and did more damage to the strawberries than if the pesticide had never been applied.” (Adapted from W.T. Keeton and J. L. Gould.

(9) (b) Read the following extract and then answer the questions below. “A migratory flight involves preparation. The initial stimulus for spring migration among birds wintering in European latitudes comes from the increase in day length past an initial threshold. Physiological changes encourage the deposition of fat, particularly beneath the skin (subcutaneous) and inside the abdomen (visceral). Fat is the vital fuel used by migrating birds, which often have to cross long stretches of sea or perhaps desert where feeding opportunities are either non-existent or very limited. Wildfowl preparing for migration, therefore, increase their food intake in order to lay down that vital fat and this shows itself in increased time spent feeding. Conveniently, for plant-eating species such as the grazing geese and wigeon, the onset of spring growth in the plants means higher levels of nutrients in the growing tips on which the birds feed.” [From Wildfowl, Ogilvie and Pearson, 1994 Hamlyn Limited] (i) What is the stimulus for spring migration?

Page 2 of 12 SECTION I COMPREHENDING (100 marks) TEXT 1 ANIMALS This adapted text is based on an edited extract from Animals , a short story by Roddy Doyle in which he tells us about George, George’s family and their pets. 1. George came home one Saturday morning. He’d been away in England. The house was empty. Sandra, his wife, had taken the kids to visit her mother in Wexford. George saw the brand new cage – and the canary. And the note, in red marker: ‘Feed it.’ And he would have, happily, if the canary hadn’t been dead. He phoned a taxi, waited an hour for it to arrive and told the driver to bring him to Wacker’s pet shop in Donaghmede. 2. Wacker had no canaries. Neither did the guy beside Woodie’s. Or the shop on Parnell Street. When the kids got home the next day they found that the canary had turned into two finches. George explained it to them; two of anything was better than one. – A fella on the plane told me that finches were much better than canaries. So I swapped the canary for these lads here. A boy and a girl. – Cool. He’d no idea at the time if this was true – the male and the female – but it must have been, because they made themselves a nest, and an egg was laid and the two finches became three. The finches, Pete and Amy – he knows the names, as solidly as his kids’ names – built a nest in the top corner. Amy stayed in there while Pete came out, hung on the bars of the cage and looked intelligent. 3. George went to his mother’s house one day to change a few light bulbs. He made a morning of it, smuggled the book he was reading out of the house, bought a takeaway coffee, drove to the sea-front and stayed there for an hour reading The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, after he’d finished at his mother’s. He drove home and walked into the end of the world. 4. Sandra and the kids had wheeled the cage outside and had started to go at it with soapy brushes and cloths. A child opened the hatch, Pete flew out, and George found four hysterical children in the kitchen, long past tears and snot, and a woman, Sandra, outside in the back garden, talking to the hedge. – I can hear him, she said. – Where? – In there, she said. She was pointing into the hedge, which stretched from the house to the end wall. George could hear the kids in the house. He could hear lawnmowers and a couple of dogs. He couldn’t hear Pete. But he did hear the big whoop of a great idea going off in his head. – Listen, he said. I’m going to bring the kids to Wacker’s, to see if Pete flew back there. Are you with me?                    Sandra looked at him. And he knew: she was falling in love with him, all over again. Source:petandgarden.com.au Page 3 of 12 N.B. Answer ONLY ONE Question A and ONLY ONE Question B. DO NOT answer a Question A and a Question B on the same text. Question A – 50 marks (i) From your reading of the above extract, what impression do you form of George?

Humorous Descriptive Realistic Explain your answer, supporting the points you make by reference to the text. (15) (iii) (a) Imagine you are Dylan.

Write the letter of application you would submit to the Manager of the pet shop. Or maybe for the first time – he didn’t care. She was in her dressing gown, looking attractively distraught, and she was staring at George like he was your man from ER. – While I’m doing that, said George, – you phone Wacker’s and tell them the story. You with me? – Brilliant. – It might work. – It’s genius. – Ah well. 5. It did work, and it was George’s greatest achievement. The happiness he delivered, the legend he planted – his proudest moment. All the gang in Wacker’s were waiting, pretending to be busy. George carried the girls up to the counter; the boys held onto him. – Dylan here’s finch flew away, said George. And he was thinking that maybe he flew back here. The lad behind the counter looked up. – Zebra finch? Dylan nodded. – He flew in twenty minutes ago. – Flaked, he was, said an older man who was piling little bales of hay and straw. Exhausted. Come over and pick him out, Dylan. 6. The new Pete wasn’t a patch on the old Pete – he was a bit drugged looking. George liked the finches but they were a pain in the neck. He was halfway to Galway one day when they had to turn back because they had forgotten about the birds and who would look after them. But then, another time, he was up earlier than usual. He went into the kitchen and saw Dylan sitting in the dawn light, watching the cage. George stood there and watched Dylan. Another of those great moments. This is why I live.

BROWN This adapted text is based on edited extracts from The Real Mrs. Brown, Brendan O’Carroll, an authorised biography by Brian Beacom. In it we discover the influence of Brendan O’Carroll’s mother, Maureen, on his popular sitcom character, Agnes Brown. 1. Flashback to 17 September, 1911 in Dublin City, Ireland. Seventeen-year-old Lizzie was set to marry Michael McHugh. The pair were madly in love and ready to head to America together to start a new life – but without telling Lizzie’s parents. Lizzie’s father was deeply against them marrying. When he heard of their romance he attacked Michael, breaking his forearm and collarbone. Michael and Lizzie knew that they had to escape Ireland. That’s why they had saved for a year to buy tickets for the long sea voyage. But Lizzie’s mother found out about the plan and convinced her husband he had to accept Michael, or he’d lose his daughter for ever. Michael and Lizzie’s father shook hands and the next day Michael McHugh put an advertisement in the newspaper offering his boat tickets for sale. The ship they would have sailed on was the Titanic. 2. Meanwhile, Lizzie and Michael became Mr. and Mrs. McHugh and a child was born. A baby girl. She was christened Maureen and she was to become Brendan O’Carroll’s mother, the woman who provided most of the inspiration for Brendan’s sitcom heroine, Agnes Brown. Speaking of his mother, Brendan O’Carroll said, ‘People used to ask me if Agnes Brown was based on my mother and I’d say no. But in recent times, I’ve come to realise just how close they are.’ Indeed. Both are battlers. Both could find a colourful adjective when roused, although Maureen was smarter and way more ambitious than the havoc-creating, uneducated, Agnes Brown. Maureen could definitely deliver a cutting one-liner, just as Agnes does. Maureen could also take a simple tea towel and turn it into a weapon, as Agnes frequently does. Both Maureen and Agnes would lay down their lives for their kids, but loved to make fun of them. Brendan’s mammy also had the ability to get what she wanted out of people, just as Agnes can, using the cleverest of psychology; becoming a bit pathetic when required. And if that didn’t work, like Agnes, she would tell the world exactly where it was going wrong. 3. Maureen’s healthy disrespect for authority – life is to be challenged; rules are there to be broken – is evident in Agnes. As Agnes does, Maureen lived in crowded houses, and managed to create her own safe little world. There are more similarities. Maureen wasn’t entirely comfortable with modern devices either. She had little time for small-minded people. Agnes Brown now, and Maureen O’Carroll then, would be ready and willing to smack the face of injustice. Source: amazon.co.uk IMAGE 1 Page 5 of 12 N.B. Answer ONLY ONE Question A and ONLY ONE Question B. DO NOT answer a Question A and a Question B on the same text. Question A – 50 marks (i) From your reading of the written text and IMAGE 2 above, what impression do you form of Maureen O’Carroll? Support your answer with reference to the text. (15) (ii) Based on Maureen O’Carroll’s experiences, outlined in the extract above, which of the following word or words do you think best describe the situation experienced by many women in Ireland in the past? Challenging Difficult Unequal Explain your answer, supporting the points you make by reference to the text. (15) (iii) (a) Based on the above text, what aspects of Agnes Brown’s character appear to be inspired by Maureen O’Carroll? Support your answer by reference to the text. (10) (b) Imagine you are either Lizzie or Michael McHugh. Write a paragraph giving your version of the events outlined in paragraph one of the above text. (10) OR Question B – 50 marks Maureen O’Carroll stood up against injustice. Write the talk that you would deliver as a podcast or radio diary in which you identify an injustice about which you feel strongly, and suggest ways in which you think this injustice could be addressed or overcome. 4. Maureen had incredible energy and studied hard, and her reward was to be sent to University College Galway, a rare achievement for a woman at that time. She became a teacher of languages, and loved her career. But on the day she married Gerry O’Carroll in 1936, she was fired from her job as it was illegal for female teachers in Ireland to be married. Did Maureen O’Carroll take this lying down? ‘My mother was a force of nature,’ Brendan recalls. ‘She said, “I’m not having that!” and joined the union and battled to get that law changed. She shares that feisty, fighting spirit with Agnes Brown.’ 5. It wasn’t a huge surprise when the Irish Labour Party asked her to run for parliament, Dáil Éireann. But it was a surprise when she won in the General Election of 1954. It was remarkable for a working-class female to achieve that level of success. What made it all the more extraordinary was that she had given birth to nine children. And, in what offers an insight into the character of Maureen O’Carroll, one of her kids, Phil, was adopted. 6. Why does Mrs. Brown’s Boys work? Agnes Brown, of course. Every family has one: the busybody, the scathing commentator, the woman with a sharp tongue who can still hug her kids like they are babies.

Brendan O’Carroll and his mother, Maureen Source: thejournal.ie IMAGE 2 Page 6 of 12 TEXT 3 TATTY This adapted text is based on an edited extract from Tatty, a novel by award-winning writer, Christine Dwyer Hickey. It is about a young girl, Tatty, and her complicated family life, from when she was a child until her early teenage years. 1. She's nearly five and gets lost at the races. One minute she is standing behind Dad, the next minute she's lost. 2. She's standing under his long brown raincoat and it's like as if she's inside her own little tent. The lining is shiny, with bumps here and there from all the stuff that fell through his raincoat pockets. The bigger things stayed in his pockets: newspaper, notebook. And there's the big fat book full of horses' names that you always see him reading. Dad tells her that when he gives her the nudge that means she has to grab a hold of his jacket because he's going to start running and she has to run out behind him. Like a circus horse, he says, do you know what I mean? 3. She doesn't, but likes the sound of it anyway and can't wait for Dad to get going. She puts her hands out of her mittens so she can get a good hold of his jacket. But the rain is too bad he says. So he changes his mind and says he'll have to leave her behind. He pulls his coat away, lifts her up and puts her down in a doorway near the men's smelly toilets. You stay here he says, till I get back. Do you hear me now? You're not to budge, not an inch. He tugs her collar up around her ears, tells her to put her mittens back on, pulls her pixie-cap down over her forehead, then leaves her. 4. As soon as she stops seeing his long brown raincoat she goes out after him. But there are too many big bodies in the way and too many brown coats and the cold rain keeps smacking her in the face. So she follows the heat back into the bar. 5. When Dad comes back to the doorway there's no sign of her anywhere and then he's up the wall. He runs around everywhere pulling at people's sleeves. Did you see? Did you see? A little girl, this size ... copper-colour hair, a fringe...? The voice from the sky calls out her name. The voice from the sky tells everyone her business – her age, her size, where she lives and what she is wearing: brown jacket, brown trousers, yellow jumper. Dad told the voice what to say; if it had been Mam the clothes would have been different. It would have been: a biscuit-coloured sheepskin coat, chocolate-brown slacks, a mustard polo-neck sweater, a creamcoloured pixie-cap. Because that's the way Mam talks about clothes, like you could eat them. 6. When Dad finds her, she's behind the counter sitting on a beer crate. She has one big rosy cheek from the big heater behind her and she's sucking a bottle of fizzy orange through a straw. She has one hand on top of the heater and her mitten is flapping from the string in the sleeve of her jacket. Dad starts shouting at the barman. Did you not hear her name being announced? Are you deaf? Ah how could I – the noise in this place? And wasn't she grand in there? You'd no business taking her like that. He didn't take me, she says. I went in myself. 7.       Then Dad starts laughing his head off. He lifts her up and sits her on the counter. She keeps on saying, I wasn’t lost, I wasn’t. You better not tell your mother, Dad says. Page 7 of 12 N.B.

When he opens the front door she runs under his arm and comes shouting into the house. Mam! Mam! I wasn't lost. I wasn't. They said I was. But I wasn't lost, I wasn't.

Read the following poem and the questions that follow at least twice before writing your answers. In this poem the poet writes about men fishing on the River Shannon. TODAY They’re fishing the river in Limerick today, bright green-waded men against the sway and the push and pull of the water’s weight, the tide’s swirl and the foam’s frothy spray. There’s the swish of the line’s cast, the swoop – mad delight in the line’s expectant alight, and the silent cry as the sound gets caught in the wind’s whirl and the seagull’s flight. Clouds bustle, bunch and swiftly separate, white tissues on a blue expanse of sky. They flutter and turn, commanded by the wind’s wild motion and the river’s roll. And the green-clothed men continue to bait until the reel and a silver splash sends them home. Vivienne McKechnie 1.

(10) Of your wild, young days which didn’t last long, for you, lovely Molly, the belle of your small town, landed up mournful and chill as the constant rain that lashes it wound into your cocoon of pain. Standing in that same hallway, ‘Don’t come again,’ you say, roughly, ‘I start to get fond of you, John, and then you are up and gone’; the harsh logic of a forlorn woman resigned to being alone. And still, mysterious blessing, I never knew, until you were gone, that, always around your neck you wore an oval locket with an old picture in it, of a child in Brooklyn. John Montague Sing a last song for the lady who has gone, fertile source of guilt and pain. The worst birth in the annals of Brooklyn, that was my cue to come on, my first claim to fame. Naturally, she longed for a girl, and all my infant curls of brown couldn’t excuse my double blunder coming out, both the wrong sex, and the wrong way around. Not readily forgiven, So you never nursed me and when all my father’s songs couldn’t sweeten the lack of money, ‘when poverty comes through the door love flies up the chimney’, your favourite saying. Then you gave me away, might never have known me, if I had not cycled down to court you like a young man, teasingly untying your apron, drinking by the fire, yarning Page 13 of 20 2.

(10) (c) Why do you think the poem is called “Revelation”? Explain your answer with reference to the poem. (10) I remember once being shown the black bull when a child at the farm for eggs and milk. They called him Bob – as though perhaps you could reduce a monster with the charm of a friendly name. At the threshold of his outhouse, someone held my hand and let me peer inside. At first, only black and the hot reek of him. Then he was immense, his edges merging with the darkness, just a big bulk and a roar to be really scared of, a trampling, and a clanking tense with the chain’s jerk. His eyes swivelled in the great wedge of his tossed head. He roared his rage. His nostrils gaped like wounds. And in the yard outside, oblivious hens picked their way about. The faint and rather festive tinkling behind the mellow stone and hasp was all they knew of the Black Mass, straining at his chains. I had always half-known he existed – this antidote and Anti-Christ his anarchy threatened the eggs, well rounded, self-contained – and the placidity of milk I ran, my pigtails thumping on my back in fear past the big boys in the farm lane who pulled the wings from butterflies and blew up frogs with straws. Past thorned hedge and harried nest, scared of the eggs shattering – only my small and shaking hand on the jug’s rim in case the milk should spill. Liz Lochhead Page 15 of 20 2.

They opened the windows and breathed Easily, while nothing moved. Then he was better. Over twelve years it has become the place Where you were sick one day on the way to the lake. You are taller now than us. The tree is taller, the house is quite covered in With green creeper, and the bend In the road is as silent as ever it was on that day. Piled high, wrapped lightly, like the one cumulus cloud In a perfect sky, softly packed like the air, Is all that went on in those years, the absences, The faces never long absent from thought, The bodies alive then and the airy space they took up When we saw them wrapped and sealed by sickness Guessing the piled weight of sleep We knew they could not carry for long; This is the place of their presence: in the tree, in the air.

They are an essential resource for examiners who receive training in the correct interpretation and application of the scheme. This training involves, among other things, marking samples of student work and discussing the marks awarded, so as to clarify the correct application of the scheme. The work of examiners is subsequently monitored by Advising Examiners to ensure consistent and accurate application of the marking scheme. This process is overseen by the Chief Examiner, usually assisted by a Chief Advising Examiner. The Chief Examiner is the final authority regarding whether or not the marking scheme has been correctly applied to any piece of candidate work. Marking schemes are working documents. While a draft marking scheme is prepared in advance of the examination, the scheme is not finalised until examiners have applied it to candidates’ work and the feedback from all examiners has been collated and considered in light of the full range of responses of candidates, the overall level of difficulty of the examination and the need to maintain consistency in standards from year to year. This published document contains the finalised scheme, as it was applied to all candidates’ work. In the case of marking schemes that include model solutions or answers, it should be noted that these are not intended to be exhaustive. Variations and alternatives may also be acceptable. Examiners must consider all answers on their merits, and will have consulted with their Advising Examiners when in doubt. Future Marking Schemes Assumptions about future marking schemes on the basis of past schemes should be avoided. While the underlying assessment principles remain the same, the details of the marking of a particular type of question may change in the context of the contribution of that question to the overall examination in a given year. The Chief Examiner in any given year has the responsibility to determine how best to ensure the fair and accurate assessment of candidates’ work and to ensure consistency in the standard of the assessment from year to year. Accordingly, aspects of the structure, detail and application of the marking scheme for a particular examination are subject to change from one year to the next without notice. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 1 LEAVING CERTIFICATE 2015 MARKING SCHEME BUSINESS, 2015 HIGHER LEVEL Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 2 Marking Scheme and Support Notes for use with the Marking Scheme. In considering the marking scheme and the support notes the following points should be noted: • The support notes presented are neither exclusive nor complete. • They are not model answers but rather a sample of possible responses. • The support notes in many cases may contain key phrases which must appear in the candidate’s answer in order to merit the assigned marks. • Further relevant points of information presented by candidates are marked and rewarded on their merits. • The detail required in any answer is determined by the context and the manner in which the question is asked and by the number of marks assigned to the answer in the examination paper. Requirements may therefore vary from year to year. • Words, expressions or phrases must be correctly used in context and not contradicted, and where there is evidence of incorrect use or contradictions the marks may not be awarded.

A merger is a friendly or voluntary amalgamation of two or more businesses for their mutual benefit. A single new legal entity is formed. Example: Glanbia plc was formed in 1997 out of the merger of Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc. A strategic alliance: When two or more independent firms agree to co-operate and share resources and expertise for the mutual benefit of all parties involved. The firms remain completely independent legally and each firm maintains its own separate trading identity. Example: Starbucks partnered with Barnes and Nobles bookstores in 1993 to provide in-house coffee shops, benefiting both retailers / Mazda and Toyota sharing technology resources etc. 10 6 Forming, storming, norming and performing are stages in team development. Outline your understanding of storming and norming.

If the euro falls in value relative to the $/£ imports will become more expensive, increasing costs for businesses e.g. imports of oil, which is a raw material for businesses, may result in businesses increasing their prices or reducing their profit margins. 10 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 12 Question Possible Response Max mark 8 1 2 34 5 E D FA C 10 9 Distinguish between Primary Picketing and Secondary Picketing as types of industrial action available to employees. Primary picketing. According to the Industrial Relations Act 1990 it is lawful for worker to walk up and down with placards at a place where their employer works or carries on business provided the picketing is for the purpose of peacefully communicating information. Secondary picketing. The act provides that secondary picketing (i.e. picketing of an employer, other than the primary employer involved in the dispute) is lawful only in situations where it is reasonable for those workers picketing to believe that the second employer was acting to frustrate the industrial action by directly assisting their employer. 10 10 Outline two methods of promoting intrapreneurship: Create a culture within the organisation where it’s okay to make mistakes/think independently. Resource provider: Make resources available to help employees to pursue their ideas (e.g. finance, time). Financial rewards for effort and creativity: These rewards could involve a mixture of pay, incentives and benefits. Teamwork encourages creativity among employees as it facilitates brain storming sessions as part of the product development process etc. 10 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 13 SECTION 2 (80 marks) This is a compulsory question based on Units 2, 3 and 4 APPLIED BUSINESS QUESTION (Support Notes) Question Possible Response Max mark A Do you think that Martin Harte displayed enterprising skills/characteristics?

All questions carry equal marks. . (Support Notes) Part 1 Question Possible Response Max mark 1 A i ii Describe one example of a co-operative relationship and one example of a source of conflict that could arise between the following stakeholders: Investor and Entrepreneur A co-operative situation would arise when the entrepreneur gives open, transparent and honest information to the investor e.g. accurate business plans and cash flow forecasts and in return the investor provides a reasonable rate or return etc. A possible source of conflict could arise if the entrepreneur gives false information to the investor / defaults on loan repayments/ does not give an adequate return to the investor/re-invests profits rather than give a return to the investor. Investor may want immediate returns and is not prepared to wait/may want greater returns out of profits rather than retaining funds in the business for further expansion. Where there is a downturn in business the entrepreneur may request more time to repay the loan while the investor may insist repayments as per agreed schedule. Supplier and Purchasing Manager A co-operative situation would arise when the supplier provides good quality raw materials, components and finished goods to the purchasing manager who pays on time and offers a fair price. A possible conflict situation could arise if poor quality materials are provided/ poor after sales service offered by the supplier. The purchasing manager fails to pay for goods purchased on credit creating a bad debt for the supplier. There may be conflict between the two sides as to their perceptions of what is a fair price and as to what the optimum quality is. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 21 Question Possible Response Max mark 1 B Illustrate your understanding of the term ‘Specific Performance’ in relation to contract law. Specific Performance is a remedy for the breach of a contract. The party in breach of a contract would be ordered by a court to carry out its agreed contractual obligations. Illustrate- Specific performance may be used as a remedy in a contract for the sale or lease of land/for the sale of a unique item such as a work of art/ completion of construction to a property or an extension to a property etc. 10 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 22 Question Possible Response Max mark 1 C i ii iii Define ‘employment discrimination’ as set out in the Employment Equality Act 1998. An employee is said to be discriminated against if he or she is treated in a less favourable way than another person is, has been or would be treated (in a comparable situation on any of the nine distinct grounds.) List three protected grounds other than gender and disability on which discrimination is outlawed under this Act. • Civil (marital) status • Family status • Sexual orientation • Religion • Age • Race • Membership of the Traveller community Evaluate the role of the Director of the Equality Tribunal in dealing with discrimination cases under this Act. The Director of the Equality Tribunal decides whether discrimination cases be examined by the Equality Mediation Officers who deal with the case in a conciliatory manner or by an Equality Officer who follows a more formal approach. The Director makes the final decision and it can be appealed to the Labour Court within 42 days. Refer the complaint to an Equality Mediator, who facilities both parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediation is an attempt to get agreement between the parties. At the end of mediation both sides sign an agreement which is legally binding so that both sides must keep to the terms of the decision. Mediation is held in private and the agreement is not published. If you do not reach an agreement through mediation you can request your case be brought to investigation. 30 The Director of the Equality Tribunal (previously known as the Director of Equality Investigations) published 22 Decisions during September 2013 in areas of discrimination that included gender and disability. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 23 Question Possible Response Max mark Investigation If you reject the offer of mediation your complaint will go to investigation handled by an Equality Officer. Investigation is also held in private. At the end of the investigation the Tribunal Equality Officer will issue a decision which is legally binding but it may be appealed by either party to the Labour Court within 42 days. All decisions by law must be published but in sensitive cases names may be withheld. Evaluation required Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 24 Question Possible Response Max mark 2 A Outline the advantages of a private limited company as a form of business ownership for a start-up business. Access to capital: One of the main advantages of the private limited company structure is the ability to raise capital by selling shares up to a maximum of 99 shareholders. Start-up costs such as R&D, technology, marketing and staffing requirements are very high. Limited liability: The shareholders of a private limited company have limited liability. This means that the shareholders are not personally liable and can only loose the amount of their original investment, if the business fails. One share one vote: A private limited company is controlled by the shareholders based on the rule “one share one vote”. The original shareholders can maintain control of the company as long as they continue to hold 51% or more of the ordinary share capital. With a private limited company the members keep control as shares are not sold on the stock exchange. Separate legal entity: The start-up business is incorporated and is a separate legal identity in the eyes of the law, meaning that it can sue or be sued in its own name and enter business contracts. This could be important in a patent case protecting the start-up from copy-cat rivals. Continuity of existence: The company is legally independent of its owners and therefore it can stay in existence even after the death of a shareholder. Other advantages: Bigger pool of talent/ Better credit rating from banks than partnerships and sole traders/increased specialisation, etc. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 25 Question Possible Response Max mark 2 B Discuss the economic effects on the Irish economy of the growth in employment in recent times. Sample responses include the following: As people have more discretionary income, people will spend more on luxury items leading to e.g. more new cars, foreign holidays being purchased. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI ) official statistics show that new car registrations in January 2015 were 31% (29,948) up on January 2014. Business confidence/growth of enterprise: Rate of unemployment in Ireland has declined from 14.2% in 2011 to 9.9% in April 2015. The demand for goods and services has increased and new businesses open or expand due to increased business profits. There is more enterprise in the economy as people’s self-esteem and confidence increases. Government current expenditure should decrease as the unemployed become employed, thereby reducing social welfare claims. This may allow the Government to increase expenditure in other areas of the economy e.g. health and education. The Government revenue/tax take will increase as receipts from major sources of taxation will rise e.g. VAT receipts will rise as there will be more consumer expenditure and PAYE receipts will rise as more people are working and paying income tax. There will be more Government finance to invest in the Irish economy. Emigration should fall and the ‘Brain drain’ (Exporting of skilled labour) should reverse. Other acceptable points: Economic growth/More FDI/Lower Government borrowing etc. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 26 Question Possible Response Max mark 2 C Discuss how a business could operate in an environmentally conscious way. Sample responses include the following: Cleaner production methods/materials substitution/energy efficiency (this can include switching to renewable energy sources). The product itself can be designed to reduce consumption of resources (e.g. reduce reliance on natural resources-use of rainwater tanks, solar hot water systems), and to prolong its useful life. By reducing the environmental impact of business it will improve the sustainability of the business. This helps achieve the goal of sustainable development. Minimise waste/safe disposal of waste: The business could adopt the 4Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle and recover. If waste is produced, every effort should be made to reuse it, if practicable. Maximisation of recycled content- recycling will conserve resources and reduce waste while it may be possible for a business to recover materials or energy from waste which cannot be reduced, reused or recycled. Pollution prevention: The use of processes, practices, materials, products or energy sources that avoid or minimise the creation of pollutants and waste, and thereby reduce the risk to human health and the environment. The idea is pollution prevention rather than pollution control. Code of Ethics: The business could establish a code of ethics which is a formal written statement setting out the modes of behaviour expected from a business in its dealings with the environment and the wider community in which it operates, encouraging a culture of openness, consultation, honesty and awareness of environmental issues etc. Other acceptable points: Regular environmental audits/Advice from the EPA (Enviromental Protection Agency)/Promotion of environmental issues (rewarding “Green” initiatives) etc. 20 “Protecting and managing Ireland's environment is a shared responsibility. It involves Government and public bodies; businesses and industry; as well as members of the public, working in partnership.” Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 27 Question Possible Response Max mark OR (Focus on qualities of an environmentally conscious business) Consult/advice-consult stakeholders before introducing policies that might affect the environment. Honest/do not cover up environmental accidents/compliant with the law. Aware/promote environmental awareness amongst staff through adequate training, which will require resources. Open to the development of new product design/ to new environmentally friendly manufacturing processes/better product end of life solutions/recycling. Sensitive to needs of society as a whole and have such safeguards as an environmental audit to ensure that it operates in an environmentally friendly manner. To achieve this it should have policies such as: Reduction of air pollution/Recycling of waste/Energy conservation/Tree planting on premises/Acceptable disposable methods/Reject excess packaging/ Have sustainable development as a top priority etc. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 28 Question Possible Response Max mark 3 A Discuss reasons why multinational companies (MNCs) may choose to locate in Ireland. Provide examples to support your answer. Corporation Tax Rate: MNCs pay 12.5% corporation tax on their profits. This low rate of corporation tax is a key Government strategy in attracting FDI. Global companies such as Intel, and Google have a major presence here and as a result it can be inferred that Ireland is a good place to do business and this international goodwill encourages other businesses to locate here. Internet companies such as Facebook, skype, eBay have followed Google. Spin-off effects. IDA Ireland is responsible for the attraction and development of foreign direct investment in Ireland. Companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook etc. have all interacted with the IDA and approximately 150,000 people are directly employed by foreign multinationals in Ireland. The availability of a highly skilled and well educated workforce. (MNCs) employ highly skilled graduates, right up to PhD level. Many of these graduates are engaged in R&D, an important area in multinational businesses. Google’s European headquarters are in Dublin. The introduction of the single currency brought additional incentives for foreign investors to locate in Ireland, along with relative price stability. The euro has made life easier for MNC’s and travelling business executives trading or visiting in the euro zone area. The creation of the Single Market eliminated trade barriers within the EU, allowing for the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital between member states. (MNCs) located in Ireland have access to a huge EU market of over 500 million people. Pharmaceutical Companies use Ireland as a stepping stone to large EU market. Ireland is an English speaking country and English is the international business language. In addition the growing number of people living in Ireland that speak different languages is a key factor in encouraging (MNCs) to locate here. Etc. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 29 Question Possible Response Max mark 3 B Illustrate your understanding of the terms standardised marketing mix and adapted marketing mix in relation to global marketing. Standardised: (Undifferentiated approach to the 4 Ps/Consistent marketing mix). Global business, like Nike, and Levis, with successful brands, aim to take the same, undifferentiated approach worldwide and use a standardised marketing mix. All products are targeted at similar groups locally. This leads to lower company costs and increased profitability. Adapted marketing mix: (Some element(s) of the marketing mix, (product, price promotion and place) is/are changed to reflect local customs, values, and economic situations). It is common for business to adapt the marketing mix to reflect regional differences, local language, cultural, geographic, or economic differences present in the market. Global Product The product may need to be adjusted to reflect technical, legal and language requirements e.g. a left hand drive car; packaging may need to be changed to cater for the needs of the local market. Examples: Starbucks adjusts its menu to fit local tastes. In Hong Kong, for example, they sell Dragon Dumplings. And as a global buyer of coffee, the company has long had a reputation for engaging local cultures according to their needs. McDonald’s varies items on its menu according to local tastes. Customers in Mexico can order a green chili cheeseburger, customers in many Arab countries can enjoy the McArabia, a grilled kofta sandwich on pita bread. Global Price Global firms attempt to achieve a uniform price in each market, however, this objective is often affected by the following factors: The cost of living in different countries/disposable incomes. Different tariffs, customs duties and VAT rates. Local price levels and prices charged by competitors in the market/exchange rate fluctuations. Global Place Global channels of distribution for physical goods tend to be longer involving more intermediaries such as exporters and agents. Examples of the various channels available include: Selling directly to customers on line 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 30 Question Possible Response Max mark Use of agent /independent person who will act on behalf of the firm generally receiving a commission on sales Forming a strategic alliance with a foreign company to produce and/or market products. Global Promotion Differences in legislation, language and culture need to be recognised in the choice of promotion such as advertising and publicity campaigns. Example The language of television advertisements may have to be amended in different countries due to language barriers or the message could be considered offensive in some countries. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 31 Question Possible Response Max mark 3 C Outline how EU directives and regulations are formulated and implemented. The European Commission is the executive body of the EU. It is the body responsible for proposing legislation/drafting legislation. These proposals are then discussed in the European Parliament and amendments to legislation can be put forward. Decisions are usually made by the Council of the European Union. It is the main decision making body of the EU etc. Once legislation is passed by the Council of the European Union and Parliament (co-decision) it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure it is implemented through a series of directives and regulations. EU Directive: It obliges member states to change their national laws to allow for EU rules, within a certain time limit. It is binding only as to the results to be achieved, leaving member states to choose, within prescribed limits, the means by which the rules and targets are to be attained. They are used to bring different national laws into line with each other and are common in matters affecting the operation of the Single Market (e.g. product safety standards, WEEE (Waste, electrical, and electronic equipment Directive, Health and Safety at work Directive.) EU Regulation: This is a legislative act of the EU which becomes enforceable immediately as law in its entirety in all member states simultaneously. It takes precedence over national law. It is self-executing and does not require any implementing measures. EU institutions can enforce a regulation throughout the EU. Regulation (EU) No.261/2004 established common rules on compensation and assistance to airline passengers. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 32 Question Possible Response Max mark 4 A i Illustrate the above data by means of a bar chart or line graph. 25 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 Sales in € Months Projected Sales of Water Conservation product Revenue July - December 2015 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 July August September October November December Sales in € Months Projected Sales of Water Conservation product Revenue July - December 2015 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 33 Question Possible Response Max mark 4 A ii Outline the principles Paul should consider to ensure he communicates his message effectively to the board of directors. Audience knowledge/Preparation: Know your audience as it will influence the tone, voice and quality of the message/Your message must reflect the education level, aims and objectives of your audience. Paul should know the strengths and weaknesses of the board/Target the message to his specific audience, the board of directors (BOD) and see things from their perspective. Accuracy: Have a thorough knowledge of the topic to be discussed/ All factual information must be accurate/ Have an introduction, plan of action and expected outcomes. Paul should anticipate the concerns of the BOD and have considered possible responses. Clarity/appropriate language/conciseness: If the language is too technical or too difficult for the board of directors to understand then the message may be misinterpreted. Paul needs to choose language appropriate to his audience and he may use short clear sentences/avoid jargon/give the bottom line. Visuals: “A picture is worth a thousand words” and visual supports such as bar charts and line graphs communicate financial data very effectively. By presenting the financial information in a chart Paul is making it easier for the BOD to process the information quicker. A power point presentation could have a strong impact. Confidentiality/safety: The medium chosen must be appropriate to the message been given. If the message is sensitive (projected sales data for a new product) meetings are more appropriate and effective. Face-to face may be more effective for sensitive information. Competitors would be very interested in Paul’s projects sales figures. Feedback: The board of directors may be looking for /or giving feedback in order to take further action in relation to the product. This may be a reason for organising a meeting as it allows for immediate feedback and clarification and provides an opportunity for Paul to eliminate any misunderstandings. Other acceptable points: Timing/appropriate method/need for record etc. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 34 Question Possible Response Max mark 4 B Outline the benefits to a business of a functional organisational structure. Due to specialisation, where each department is concentrating exclusively on one function such as marketing, production, sales or finance, employees and management build up high levels of skill and expertise through repetition and practice. This leads to efficiencies as tasks get done quickly and to a high standard. The chain of command and line of authority is clear. Clear lines of authority exist and employees know who to report to. There is a person in charge of each department which improves co-ordination and motivation, as employees know what is expected of them and when. There is accountability as someone is responsible for each section. There are clear communication channels. The structure helps create a clear communication line between the top and bottom of the business. Instructions flow downward from top management along the chain of command and information is communicated upward. It may result in important information being communicated quickly leading to quicker decision-making. Functional Organisational Structures allow for a wide span of control. There are economies of scale as resources are used efficiently with no duplication of resources. The wide span of control releases top management from micromanaging operations, so that they can focus on the overall strategy of the business. Promotional Paths: Visible hierarchical ladder, providing career paths for employees/ provides scope for the promotion to the next level so businesses can promote from within etc. 15 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 35 Question Possible Response Max mark 4 C Explain the methods a business could consider to minimise the risk of bad debts as part of its credit control system. Assess customers’ creditworthiness: The credit worthiness of potential customers is checked in advance, e.g. asking for bank references, trade references, credit bureau. Set appropriate credit limits and credit periods: Draw up clear terms and conditions controlling the amount of credit and ensuring that payments are made on time e.g. a credit limit of €5,000 and a time limit of one month. Offer incentives such as a cash discount for early or prompt payment. Policy for late payments/partial payments: agreeing on penalties for late payments and implementing them, e.g. charging interest on overdue accounts. Have an efficient administrative system where invoicing, payment demands and follow up phone calls and visits occur promptly to ensure payment/ Take legal action or threaten legal action to ensure payment/Put credit facility on hold until account is cleared. Adopt a cash sales only policy with certain customers etc. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 36 Question Possible Response Max mark 5 A i Draft and label a Product Life Cycle. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE SALES Introduction Growth Maturity Saturation Decline TIME 25 5 A ii Describe one characteristic of each stage of the product life cycle with reference to a product of your choice. Example required: Introduction: There is heavy expenditure on promoting the product and the company has to decide on a suitable pricing strategy e.g. Apple went for a high pricing strategy while Samsung went for a lower pricing strategy in order to capture market share. Slow Sales Growth / High Expenditure (Advertising, Sales promotion, Distribution) / Negative cash flow/ No profits. Growth: Investment in production capacity is needed to keep up with demand. The company must be ready to improve the design of the product, tweaking a feature such as internet access or the size of the screen on the iPhone 6, in order to compete. Rapid Sales Growth / Costs falling / Positive Cash Flow / Growing profits/Expanded production requiring further investment. Maturity: Sales and profits reach a peak/start to level off and the product has reached most customers in the market. The focus may be on how to extend its life and maintain its competitiveness. Advertising may be reinforcing or reminding customers of the product. Other markets may be sought (e.g. mobile phones in China). Rival products may enter market. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 37 Question Possible Response Max mark Sales increasing but at decreasing rate / Profits reach a peak & start to level off / If no further product development it may go into decline. Saturation: Sales begin to slow down and intensive advertising and promotion take place to maintain market share. Brand loyalty is vital at this stage. The big mobile phone companies spend millions of dollars each year on advertising and promotion. According to Reuters, Samsung spent an estimated $14 billion on marketing in 2013. Sales slowing down as market saturated / Costs up (Advertising & Sales promotion)/ Prices may fall to encourage consumption. Decline: Sales and profits begin to fall and there may be an effort made to extent the product life or to re-launch the product in a new market. For example Smartphone technology lead to the demise of the Nokia handheld mobile phone. Sales & Profits falling / Withdrawal of product from the market / Product could be re-launched in a different market/ Product harvesting (selling a product in decline without any expenditure on promotion for short-term gain. 5 B i ii Feasibility Study; Test Marketing; Product Screening and Prototype Development are stages in the new Product Development Process. List the four stages/steps above in the correct order. 1. Product Screening 2. Feasibility Study 3. Prototype Development 4. Test Marketing Outline your understanding of any three of these stages. Product screening (Screening Ideas): All ideas are vetted and the impractical and unworkable ideas are dropped, leaving the most viable ones for further examination and development. Careful screening helps businesses avoid huge expenses in developing ideas that are subsequently not marketable and ensures that good opportunities are not lost. Feasibility Study: This is carried out to assess if a product has potential. It looks at whether it can be produced technically (production feasibility) and if it will be profitable (financial feasibility). It seeks answers to questions such as, what will it cost to produce and can the business afford it? 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 38 Question Possible Response Max mark Prototype Development: This stage involves developing a sample or model of a product. It is produced to see what materials are required to make it. It can be used to test the product to see if it conforms to certain standards and to determine what adjustments/ improvements can be made before deciding to go into full production. Test Marketing/Product Testing: It involves doing a small-scale trial to identify possible faults and to assess customer reaction. The product is tested on a sample of potential consumers before going into full production. 5 C Read the information supplied and answer the question which follows. Discuss the key issues Lia will have to address before setting up her business enterprise. Raising finance/capital: Lia will decide how much debt capital and equity capital she is going to use as sources of finance for the growth and expansion of her business. Debt capital carries the risks associated with being highly geared. Fixed interest repayments on debt capital must be made regardless of profitability. Production method A firm must choose an appropriate method of production that suits the type of good being manufactured and the potential demand for the product. Job or batch production have different demands in terms of automation, staffing and storage. Lia will have to opt for job or batch production in order to manufacture the different range of products she is selling. Ownership options: An ownership structure has to be decided upon. Different structures have different demands in terms of risk, control, ownership, liability, tax implications etc. It would be advisable for Lia to choose a private limited company structure because of the benefits of limited liability, incorporation and raising finance etc. Marketing her business: Finding customers/ Market research/Deciding on brand /USP/Advertising etc. Availability of services: (Infrastructure/Utilities/Labour etc.) 15 Having been made redundant, Lia O’Brien has decided to set up her own enterprise manufacturing individually designed disposable tableware and paper cups for small coffee shops and restaurants. She recognises, however, that having an idea and having the will to succeed will not be enough to ensure success. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 39 Question Possible Response Max mark 6 A i ii iii Read the information supplied and answer the questions which follow. PRIVATE MOTOR INSURANCE PROPOSAL FORM DECLARATION I/We declare to the best of my/our knowledge and belief that the information given on this form is true and complete in every respect. Outline the function of an insurance proposal form. Insurance Proposal forms are used to apply for insurance cover and the company is given full particulars of the risk against which the insurance protection is desired. Insurance Proposal form helps the insurance company to calculate the premium based on all the potential risks in relation to the insurance policy. Explain the principle of insurance referred to in the extract from the above private motor Insurance proposal form. Utmost Good Faith: All material facts must be revealed. The person taking out the insurance must answer all the questions truthfully. Failure to do so can make the insurance cover worthless. If the insurance contract is obtained by way of fraud or misrepresentation it is void e.g. a driver should declare truthfully the number of penalty points on his licence. Outline two other principles of insurance that apply to insurance contracts. Indemnity: An insured person cannot make a profit from an insurance claim i.e. insurance can at best put an insured person in the same financial position as they were prior to a loss occurring. If a car is written off in an accident the insured receives its replacement value and not the original sum paid for it. Insurable Interest: The insured must gain from the existence of the exposure unit and suffer from its loss. You can insure your own car but not your neighbours. In essence you can't insure something unless you have a vested interest in it. Subrogation: If a third party is responsible for damaging your car in an accident and you are compensated by your own insurer, your insurer can then sue the other driver. Subrogation says when you accept an insurance settlement, the insurer gets your right to sue the third party. This prevents you collecting twice for the same damage and gives your insurer a way to recoup its losses. Fundamentally the principle is linked to indemnity ensuring that a person doesn’t profit from insurance. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 40 Question Possible Response Max mark Contribution: This principle states that if you hold more than one insurer liable for your losses, they have to share the loss. If you take out two polices on your car, you can't collect from both insurers. One company would pay you and then collect from the second, or both companies would share the compensation payment between them. Fundamentally the principle is linked to indemnity ensuring that a person doesn’t profit from insurance 6 B Outline the benefits of performance appraisal for employees in a business. Rewards/Monetary and Non Monetary: It may be used in determining pay increases for employees and other awards such as share option schemes, benefits in kind etc. Motivation/Job satisfaction: Performance appraisal is important for staff motivation, communicating and fostering a positive relationship between management and staff/ ensures high performance standards/working to full potential/ happy in the job. Industrial relations: Potential conflicts in the workplace may be highlighted through performance appraisals. This enables the business to help address and solve problems/issues between management & employees and helps improve industrial relations in the workplace/clarifications provided. Training and development: The performance appraisal interview can identify training and career development needs for employees and provide appropriate training/ Can evaluate the effectiveness of training programmes already provided. Feedback: It provides an opportunity for employees to give and receive feedback, which may improve the employee’s job satisfaction/motivation. Evaluate the performance of management and employees: The goals set the previous year and the employee’s achievements during the year are discussed and reviewed/ problem areas identified. Priorities and goals are set by mutual consent for the following year providing clarity for the employee/ Two-way communication/ the employees are appraised on their own performance. Promotional path/Recognition: It identifies hidden strengths in employees which can be used and recognised/ achievements are recognised through promotion/helps promotion decisions. 15 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 41 Question Possible Response Max mark 6 C i Explain the reasons Amrod Ltd would prepare a cash flow forecast. It will help Amrod Ltd manage its cash flow and live within its means. It acts as a financial control mechanism that can be used to measure actual cash flow against planned cash flow encouraging Amrod Ltd to plan its finances sensibly and live within its means and not to overtrade/Avoids cash flow problems as costs are considered in advance/ to ensure it has sufficient funds. It will help Amrod Ltd identify periods of time in the future when the business will have an excess of expenditure over income i.e. a deficit and then take corrective action/assess the best methods to deal with the cash shortfall/ Enable Amrod Ltd to use its scarce resources more effectively. It will help Amrod Ltd identify periods of time in the future when the business will have a surplus of income over expenditure. Amrod Ltd can then make plans to place these surplus funds on deposit with a financial institution or make expansion decisions. It will help Amrod Ltd gain access to finance from financial institutions as the cash flow forecast is an integral part of the business plan given to banks and other potential investors/ Supports applications for loans and grants etc. 25 6 C ii Calculate the figures represented by the letters A, B and C on the cash flow forecast. A = (€10,000) =2m B = (€30,000)= 2m (90,000 -120,000)= 1m C = €20,000 =2m 6 C iii Financial Problem: The deficits months are October and December. How to address: Avail of a short-term source of finance: Amrod Ltd could arrange a bank overdraft facility with its bank to finance problem months where the business is running a deficit. The overdraft facility provides extra flexibility for Amrod Ltd when it needs it most. However, care should be taken because the rate of interest charged on a bank overdraft is high. Other short term sources could be considered such as trade credit (delaying payment to creditors/ seeking an extension period of credit from creditors). Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 42 Question Possible Response Max mark Adjust receipts: Its receipts in October and December could be increased by changing its marketing mix, e.g. lowering price to sell more, increasing the price depending on elasticities, designing new products or more effective promotion campaigns/reducing period of credit given to debtors/cash sales only. Adjust payments: The business could decrease its cash payments by sourcing cheaper suppliers, restructuring loan repayments or asking employees to take a wage decrease. By moving €10,000 of payments from October to November, the company would break even at the end of October etc. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 43 Question Possible Response Max mark 7 A Read the information supplied and answer the question which follows. Explain the product, price and place elements of the marketing mix. (Relate your explanations to Kurve Ltd.) Product/Service The item/service being sold plus anything related to how it is made, packaged and named. The business needs to consider product/service options, the after-sales service, warranties and servicing etc. Product design (Functionality): the product must take account of consumer legislation such as the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 which puts a legislative onus on producers to manufacture products or provide services that are of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose intended. The product/service must do what it is expected to do. The product (service) that Kurve Ltd offers is designed as a ‘digital Television service’. Branding Having a brand name makes it easier to distinguish the product/service from competitor’s products/services. Branding can be used as a marketing tool for advertising purposes. New products/services are easier to introduce if the brand name is already well known. Brand names can be registered to protect the owner so that no other firm can use that name. Branding helps buyers to identify a particular supplier’s goods/ services and create and maintain their confidence in the performance of the brand encouraging, brand loyalty. The brand name is “VISION” 25 Kurve Ltd provides broadband, phone and television services to homes in the Irish market. In January 2015 it launched its new digital television service ‘VISION’, providing different bundles of channels at different prices. It charges a reduced subscription for the first six months to new customers. Orders can be placed directly on line. The business operates in a highly competitive market and plans to increase its sales revenues by 20 % over the next two years. Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 44 Question Possible Response Max mark 7 7 B B i ii Price Premium pricing/penetration pricing/cost-plus pricing. Competition is very intense in the broadband /digital TV sector and this will influence the price to be charged. Decisions on price affect the viability of the brand and the profitability of the business, so great care is needed when deciding on the price to charge. Consumers may use price as a judge of quality/therefore one must be cautious around low prices. The pricing strategy that Kurve Ltd has opted for is a low pricing strategy called penetration pricing in order to capture market share as quickly as possible. “It charges a reduced subscription for the first six months to new customers.” “Providing different bundles of channels at different prices.” Place The place element is about distributing the right product/service to the customer at the right place and at the right time. The most suitable channel of distribution must be used. Selling Direct /selling online is convenient for the consumer and cuts out the costs associated with intermediaries/no retailer margin being involved in the distribution process. It brings the organisation closer to the customer. Companies can advertise and sell their products on line using a company web site. Consumers place orders on line and the service is provided or in the case of physical goods the products are delivered using the postal system or a courier delivery service. The channel of distribution chosen by Kurve Ltd to get its product to the market place is the direct channel as, ‘Orders can be placed directly on line’-is direct to the consumer via the internet. Explain the term ‘Public Relations' (PR). Public Relations refers to all activities related to creating a good public image for the product or service amongst its stakeholders. It aims to achieve favourable publicity and build a good corporate image for the business/ its concern is the long-term objective of promoting a favourable image of the business. Discuss methods a business could consider to generate good Public Relations. Publicity: Public Relations can take the form of press releases or press conferences where the media are given information about the company’s activities. 20 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 45 Question Possible Response Max mark 7 7 C C i ii Sponsorship is another form where businesses pay money so that their product name will be displayed by individuals, organisations or at particular events or stadia. It can be very effective at positioning a business (sponsoring of sports events or TV programmes). Businesses can position themselves as big, national, popular, traditional etc. e.g. The Aviva stadium, 3arena in Dublin, the Cork Guinness Jazz festival, Irish Independent Park (formally Musgrave Park in Cork) and Kellogs GAA Cúl camps. Celebrity endorsements where celebrities are paid to endorse or be associated with the business and its brand. The celebrities market the product through television or radio advertisements, large event appearances etc. Businesses use celebrities in their marketing hoping to drive up sales and have a positive impact on profits. e.g. Beyonce and Taylor Swift both became “brand ambassadors” for Pepsi Amy Huberman-Newbridge Silver Brian O’Driscoll-Gillette Katie Taylor-Bank of Ireland. Other PR strategies include: Annual reports; company brochures; publicity literature; promotional films /Donations to charity/ Local community relations/After Sales Service etc. Define the term ‘market segmentation’. Market segmentation involves dividing up the market into clearly identifiable sections which have common characteristics. It allows a firm to identify who their target market is. It involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers, businesses, or countries that have common needs and priorities, and then designing and implementing strategies to target them. Illustrate two methods a business could consider to segment its market. Demographic (who are you targeting?) You can segment markets by many different characteristics, such as age, income, gender etc. When you have your customers grouped by demographics, you can target your strategies to reach them specifically, as people from certain demographic groups often react the same way to marketing. e.g. Age: Businesses often target certain age groups, such as toothpaste products for children and adults and toys for different ages. e.g. Gender: Males and females are targeted with different types of clothing, hairdressing, magazines, toiletries and cosmetics. 15 Leaving Certificate: Business – Higher Level 2015 46 Question Possible Response Max mark Geographic- (where are you targeting?) This uses basic geographic measures such as nations, states, cities, regions, and neighbourhoods, climate, density of populations, and the rate at which populations are growing to segment the market. By using segments such as urban versus rural, north versus south, sea coasts versus interior, warm areas versus cold, the business can design a marketing strategy to satisfy the chosen target markets. e.g. Fáilte Ireland segmenting the country into regions such as the Cork/Kerry region, Wild Atlantic Way or City Breaks etc. e.g. Newspaper/Radio: local regional and national. Psychological- (why are you targeting?) Markets divided into groups based on personality, lifestyle and value variables. e.g Cars to suit different life styles (hybrid an economically efficient and environmentally friendly car) /sports gear etc. END Blank Page Blank Page Blank Page  ")

At its peak the company employed highly skilled shoe makers and a very effective sales team. Martin Harte, the owner, began to realise that the centuries-old footwear industry was in decline, largely as a result of cheaper imports from manufacturers in Eastern Europe. He decided to review the company's corporate strategy in order to make his company viable in the future. His solution was based on the ever increasing popularity of Irish dance worldwide. The outstanding success of productions such as Riverdance, Lord of the Dance and the popularity of competitions such as the Irish Dance World Championships have seen a global increase in the numbers of girls and boys learning Irish dancing. Martin's goal was to create a range of soft and hard dance shoes, using the finest and most durable leather, and so well engineered that they would provide protection and comfort for Irish dancers worldwide. He sought the assistance of Enterprise Ireland’s ‘Get Export Ready’ scheme. Enterprise Ireland appointed Christine Landers, a Development Adviser, to Harte Shoes Ltd and she carried out a SWOT analysis. From this, it was clear that Harte Shoes Ltd had manufacturing expertise and that growing markets exist in the UK, America and Australia due to the global popularity of Irish dancing. However, she noted the lack of a computer aided design system (CAD) to assist with the production of shoes, especially in light of the fact that competitors from Eastern Europe had invested heavily in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). She also noted the absence of a quality website to facilitate online selling. Martin discussed the SWOT analysis with existing employees and at that meeting a way forward was agreed. Martin invested a further €50,000 into the business to be used for modernising plant and equipment. Grant aid received from Enterprise Ireland was used for a new computer aided design system (CAD) and a website was established to showcase the new brand and to get orders from clients. Employees were given the required training and development through up-skilling courses organised by the company. Significant productivity improvements were achieved by introducing bonus shares for employees and offering a fair redundancy scheme. Martin was delighted with the innovative approach adopted by the design team in creating a range of quality hard and soft dance shoes. He welcomed their suggestions on the technical aspects of manufacturing hard dance shoes which included fibreglass heels and toes to increase the clicking sound, so important to Irish dance. His team developed a newly patented production technique enabling them to produce a dance shoe that is the lightest and loudest in the marketplace. (A) Do you think that Martin Harte displayed enterprising skills/characteristics? Explain your answer with reference to the text of the ABQ. (20 marks) (B) (i) Define the management activity of planning. (ii) Explain the elements of a SWOT analysis and conduct the SWOT prepared by Christine Landers.

In 2008 Shay was enjoying life in Australia and perfecting his big wave surfing skills when he read an article in the ‘National Geographic’ describing the quality of the giant waves surfers were experiencing along the west coast of Ireland. Inspired by the article and having always wanted to have his own business he decided to return home from Australia in 2008 to set up Atlantic Surf. Having tried and failed in business in the past Shay realised that he needed to carry out some market research and get assistance with this venture. Shay contacted the Irish Surfing Association (ISA) and received valuable advice on health and safety legislation, on how to network and on the importance of having a web presence. He prepared a business plan and received a business start-up grant of €10,000 from Donegal County Enterprise Board. He used the grant together with €30,000 he had saved while working in Australia to establish Atlantic Surf, an ISA approved surfing school. From the outset Shay understood that location would be a key factor driving business success. While researching property sites he spotted a suitable retail premises located on the seafront at Summerstown. The property was advertised as being available for immediate use for an annual rent of €10,000. Given the economic climate at the time and the collapse in property prices in Summerstown, Shay believed that a better deal could be agreed. He telephoned the landlord and suggested a more realistic price of €7,500. This price was rejected and both parties entered into negotiations with the objective of concluding a legal contract. In April 2009, just before celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday, Shay was delighted when the landlord said yes to an annual rent of €8,000. Shay secured the premises and paid €8,000 to the landlord. The necessary documentation for the rental was signed in the solicitor’s office in time for the busy summer surfing season. Shay decided to open a ‘one stop surf shop’ in the rented premises and appointed Karen, a champion surfer, as its manager. The shop sells high quality stock including wetsuits, surfboards, kite surfing equipment and Atlantic Surf branded beach clothing. In addition, it rents out wetsuits and surfboards. From the beginning, Karen adopted a cash sales only policy with customers and negotiated a 30 day credit period with suppliers. While very pleased with the high stock turnover of the Atlantic Surf branded beach clothing, she had some concerns because the annual stocktake revealed a high level of kite surfing equipment still unsold. To assist with cash flow, Karen decided to use the website to highlight offers such as 6 surfing lessons for the price of 5 if payment is made in advance. Karen believes quality development is key to business success and she is hoping to apply for Quality Standard Certification in the near future. (A) Illustrate what it means to be an entrepreneur with reference to Atlantic Surf. (20 marks) (B) ‘For a contract to be legally enforceable certain essential elements must exist.’ Discuss this statement with reference to the rental of the premises by Shay Doherty for Atlantic Surf.

It was founded by two college graduates, David Whelan and Jane Ward. David is a software engineer and a web architect while Jane is a marketing graduate. Their design team recently identified some ideas for new games in action-adventure, music, and e-learning. After reviewing the various ideas put forward, ‘Knights' Domain’, a new action-adventure game that involved building a fantasy kingdom, was chosen. The design team decided to use Irish music and cutting-edge graphics to set the game apart. Jane completed a business report, including a detailed break-even analysis, to determine the potential of ‘Knights' Domain’. Following on from this report, the design team introduced more challenging levels to the game and added more 3D graphics. The game was introduced to a group of transition year students from a local secondary school, who commented positively on the different levels and on its distinctive graphics. The product ‘Knights' Domain’ was launched in various games stores with an advertising campaign accompanying the launch.

Page 5 of 12 SECTION 2 (80 marks) This is a compulsory question based on Units 3, 4 and 5 APPLIED BUSINESS QUESTION Clothes-4-Us Ltd Clothes-4-Us Ltd established its first retail store in Galway city in 1990. Its mission statement focuses on providing ‘fashionable fast moving clothing’ as well as ‘value for money’ for young fashion-conscious consumers. Its founder, Aoife Coyle, was determined from a very young age to become an entrepreneur and she chose the fashion industry because of her love of clothes. Under her guidance the business has expanded and now employs 600 staff in twenty retail stores located in prime sites throughout Ireland. The business continues to grow steadily. Strong performance in the Irish market and many years of profitability has encouraged Aoife to expand her successful business model into the UK clothing market. Monthly meetings are held to manage the growth and expansion of the business. Strategies have been put in place in the event of possible disruptions in the supply of essential stocks from global suppliers. Recently it was decided to undertake an advertising campaign on UK television to coincide with the opening of the company’s first store in London’s Oxford street. Oliver Quinn, the Human Resource manager, has played a central role in the steady growth of Clothes-4-Us Ltd. He continues to effectively manage employee numbers. For the planned opening of the store in London, Oliver advertised job opportunities on the company’s website and included an on-line application form. With increasing competition in the market coupled with recessionary times, Aoife and Oliver recognise the necessity to invest in staff training. A comprehensive induction programme is provided throughout the company and personnel from the Human Resource department meet employees annually to review their progress. Employees at Clothes-4-Us Ltd are well rewarded and there are opportunities for promotion for those who achieve their sales targets. Aoife is concerned that the business may lose market share because of increased competition from rival ‘copycat’ fashion multiples. She has begun visiting the company’s stores unannounced to monitor sales, employee behaviour and customer trends. In addition, the marketing department is carrying out regular consumer surveys. Fashion magazines with their coverage of the latest designer ‘catwalk’ fashion trends from Milan, Paris and London are closely monitored. The company’s daily sales records and data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on market size and consumer expenditure patterns are continually analysed. Aoife believes that a renewed emphasis on its unique selling point (USP) of fashionable budget clothing, targeted at the young fashion-conscious consumer, will position Clothes-4-Us Ltd as the market leader. With this in mind the business has updated its slogan to “Affordable Fashion” which it will use for its advertising campaign in the UK market. (A) (i) Define the management activity of ‘planning’. (ii) Illustrate how different types of planning benefit Clothes-4-Us Ltd. (20 marks) (B) Evaluate the effectiveness of the Human Resource department at Clothes-4-Us Ltd.

Workings Page 6 of 12 SECTION 2 (80 marks) This is a compulsory question based on Units 2, 3, and 4 Applied Business Question Castlewest Hotel and Conference Centre Castlewest Hotel and Conference Centre was established by Mary Cullen in 1994. Having worked in senior management positions within the hospitality sector for many years, Mary identified a niche in the local market for a hotel providing a high standard of service and comfort, while offering customers value for money. Located in the west of the country, Castlewest Hotel and Conference Centre enjoys an excellent reputation for delivering a personal and professional service to holidaymakers, businesses and passing trade. Independent online reviews of the hotel continue to compliment the very helpful and friendly staff. The hotel was totally refurbished and extended to include a state-of-the-art Conference Centre in 2005. A significant investment in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has taken place within the hotel in recent years. The Marketing Manager, Pat Butler, redesigned the website to include an on-line booking facility, which also provides a customer database. Complimentary Wi-Fi (internet access) is available throughout the hotel, while the Conference Centre is equipped with the latest video and audio conferencing facilities. Technology is also used in the day-to-day operations of the hotel, from stock ordering to managing the hotel’s accounts. Mary Cullen adopts a hands-on approach in her role as General Manager and can be seen daily walking around the hotel, talking to staff and customers and getting feedback. Despite her long working hours, she is also president of the local Chamber of Commerce. Using the hotel intranet, Judy O’Brien, the Assistant Manager, provides a weekly update to all staff on the hotel’s performance. She has also developed a voluntary suggestion scheme where staff are encouraged to come up with innovative ideas for improvements, for which they are rewarded. Recently Dylan Jones, the Head Chef, was named ‘Employee of the Month’ for introducing a ‘Lunch to Go’ menu, which has increased weekday lunch sales. Bookings and sales overall have fallen in the past 18 months, as individuals and businesses have cut spending. Hotel rates have been reduced in an effort to attract more business, and a range of costcutting measures were introduced, including closure of the hotel for the month of January.

The business imports, supplies and installs energy efficient solar panels that are used to heat homes and businesses. While attending a Trade Fair in Germany on behalf of his previous employer, Liam identified a niche in the market for an Irish supplier of solar panels. With twenty years experience in the heating and plumbing supplies business and with no opportunity for promotion, he decided to start his own business. Impressed with Liam’s knowledge and belief in his product, Liam’s bank manager and a number of private investors were happy to provide the necessary finance. The business grew rapidly and by the end of 2007 had a turnover of €30 million and a workforce of thirty. The past year, however, has been difficult for the business. As the construction of new houses has fallen, there has been a steady decline in the sales of solar panels. Costs are rising and the business is finding it more difficult to pass on price increases to customers. Cash flow is tight and Liam is particularly concerned by the fact that two of his largest customers have not paid their bills on time. In addition, the company is finding it difficult to raise short term finance due to the current credit squeeze. Rising stock levels in the warehouse are also causing problems. A number of customers have recently returned solar panels, as a result of damage caused while in storage in the warehouse or in transit. Liam is confident that the demand for green energy sources in Ireland will increase again. He believes that the government’s new Building Energy Rating (BER) regulations, combined with the increasing demand for more cost effective and environmentally friendly heating systems, will provide opportunities for his business. However, Liam has e-mailed all staff informing them that action will need to be taken swiftly if the business is to survive the current downturn in the economy. To avoid the introduction of compulsory redundancies, Liam explains in his e-mail that it will be necessary to implement a 10% pay cut, with immediate effect for all workers. The staff contacted their trade union to express their concerns about the proposed pay cuts. A trade union meeting has been organised to discuss staff concerns and agree a response to the pay cut proposed by Liam. (A) Illustrate, using examples from the above text, four enterprising characteristics/skills shown by Liam. (20 marks) (B) Discuss three types of management control that you would recommend Liam put in place to secure the future of RES Ltd. (30 marks) (C) (i) Describe, using the above text, one possible non-legislative and one legislative solution for the industrial relations problem facing RES Ltd.

Workings Page 5 of 12 SECTION 2 (80 marks) This is a compulsory question based on Units 5, 6, and 7 Applied Business Question Fruit First Ltd Fruit First Ltd produces a range of ‘smoothies’, a fruit drink made from crushed fruit. Mary Ryan, a food scientist in the food industry, identified a gap in the market for an Irish supplier of natural fruit drinks. In her spare time she produced a batch of smoothies, supplying samples to local shops. Encouraged by the favourable responses, she left her job and set up Fruit First Ltd in 2001. The business, based in the midlands, sources fresh fruit locally and from abroad. Bringing new investors on board in 2006 enabled Fruit First to invest in larger premises, doubling its production capacity. Profits are approaching €1million and the business now employs thirty full-time workers. The chilled drink products come in attractively designed cartons of different sizes, supplied by a local firm. Fruit First vans deliver the products to retail outlets, nutrition shops and fitness centres nationwide. Mary’s focus on producing a quality product has allowed her command a higher price than her competitors. Annual investment in research and development has led to a widening of the product range and development of a green image for the business. Initially Mary used local supermarkets to encourage consumers to taste the products. Over time Fruit First’s marketing strategies expanded and the brand has now become associated with ‘National Healthy Heart Day’. As the leading Irish supplier of smoothies, further expansion in the small Irish market is unlikely. Mary sees the potential to grow the business and she is considering entering the UK market initially and subsequently the wider EU market. While recognising the high cost base in Ireland and the perishable nature of the product, Mary has begun developing an export strategy. Fruit First is in discussion with a leading food retailing chain in relation to supplying shops throughout the UK. Mary views this as an opportunity and a necessary step before entering the wider EU marketplace. (A) Evaluate the elements of the marketing mix for Fruit First Ltd.

Applied Business Question McGComputers McGComputers was founded in 1986 by Jason McGinley. It is an independent firm specialising in the sale and repair of computers, operating from a premises fronting onto the main street of a large town. Jason had worked a standard five-day week in his previous job, as a qualified engineer, with a transnational computer company. The new venture forced him to adjust to working long and irregular hours, and to manage with limited financial resources. The change also meant a review of his commitments to health and life plans, and the provision of his home as security. While his formal bookkeeping skills were limited, he maintained details of all customers and their transactions. Responding to published official forecasts and trade publications, Jason recruited sales people and qualified technicians to serve the client base and expand the product range of the firm. He encouraged the staff to engage with customers and to note their reactions to new ideas and products. His reliance on trust in the staff has been successful in that only one employee has had to be dismissed for theft. McGComputers is now well established with twelve full-time employees and five service vehicles on the road. It regularly hosts product presentations and demonstrations on its premises for representative sections of its customer base. Siobhán, Jason’s daughter, a recent business graduate has joined the firm. Siobhán would like to add other services such as website design and maintenance, training and consultancy, and has held focused discussions with groups of customers. This has led Jason to consider reorganising the firm and leaving the day-to-day running with Siobhán. Overall policy control would rest with him, supported by a limited number of reward-seeking investors.

Applied Business Question. Stylish Décor Ltd. Ruth Cavanagh became Managing Director of Stylish Décor Ltd., a retail and wholesale business, one year ago. She took over the paint, wallpaper and tiling business when her father Paddy retired. Paddy had been a popular employer locally but the business had not grown and kept pace with developments in technology, marketing or human resource management. The company’s premises is based in an expanding town within a one-hour commuting distance of Dublin and is in need of modernisation. The town has seen a large increase in new house building over the last few years and its development plan provides for further housing and industrial units. Ruth is ambitious. Her aim is to become a market leader. Research has convinced her of the benefits of adding a ‘Do-ItYourself’ (DIY) department to the existing business and setting up a second shop in a town less than twenty-kilometres away. These initiatives will require an increase in staff, a retraining programme for existing staff, incentives, and capital investment, if the business is to succeed. Ruth is a Business graduate and understands the importance of marketing for the success of a business. Her enterprise’s market share and turnover are below those of comparable businesses. Ruth intends to penetrate the market by a further fifty-percent within the next five years, to improve the expertise of staff, the quality of customer service and the product range. The fact that a major multiple is due to open a new hardware and gardening outlet with good parking just fourkilometres away has concentrated her mind. Stylish Décor Ltd. has not, up to now, invested in marketing activities. She also intends to introduce clearly defined lines of responsibility for staff in the areas of purchasing, sales/marketing and offer employees rewards for achieving targets. She wants to make changes and respond to customer needs quickly but she is facing strong opposition from her staff.

Page 6 of 12 SECTION 2 (80 Marks) This is a compulsory question based on Units 2, 3 and 4. Applied Business Question. Circuit Ltd Tom Ryan is the main shareholder in a busy electrical company. Tom had been working as a fulltime electrician with a local building firm, with whom he served his time as an apprentice, when he realised that the construction industry was changing and that subcontracting of specific areas of work would become the norm. He set up Circuit Ltd to provide electrical services in 1972. Tom gained many building and maintenance contracts with a range of local firms and soon had to take on employees to meet the demand. He was very flexible with his customers and was willing to work late and at weekends. As the business expanded Tom regularly took on apprentice electricians and all the current employees had trained, or were in training, with the firm. He personally handled the recruitment, selection and development of all staff. He placed emphasis on loyalty, commitment and honesty which he rewarded with regular substantial bonuses. He did not recognise any trade union within the firm but paid the recommended trade union rates to his apprentices and the firm experienced few industrial relations problems or health and safety difficulties. The business employed thirty electricians and trainees, as well as three office staff, by the beginning of 2005 when the annual turnover of the company had grown to €1.5 million. Tom decided that he would develop a specialised department to concentrate on installing wireless computer networks, using a new and promising technology. This would allow the firm to tender for high margin contracts and would require redeployment of half of the current staff and extensive retraining for them in new skills. He felt that he also may have to make changes to his current management activities for this major development to succeed. (A) Explain, using examples, the enterprising characteristics/skills shown by Tom. (20 marks) (B) Evaluate Tom’s effectiveness as a Human Resource Manager. (30 marks) (C) What advice on management activities would you give to Tom in relation to the new network installation department? Make relevant assumptions where necessary.

The name is also that of a new business venture that Clodagh has recently established. An engineering graduate with a flair for design, she has, to her credit, won two innovation awards for product development in recent years. Clodagh sees a bright future for a business with original ideas in the growing childrens’ leisure business.
